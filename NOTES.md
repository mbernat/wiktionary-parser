# Notes

## Development

### current development process:
1. implement new functionality
2. write some testing code mixed with it
3. run the main binary
4. repeat until the program is doing what I want

### A nicer way:
1. write code
2. load it into the repl and play with it -> directly see what it's doing
Problems:
1. preparing the repl environment to test more complex code needs a script (essentially the equivalent of a binary I run anyway)
2. repl needs to support good development (much like RLS)
3. repl needs to integrate with the editor
